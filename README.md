Energy Eigenfunction Solver
===
By: Feynman Liang

This document describes solving the 1D Time-Independent Schrodinger Equation
using Forward Euler for numerical integration and the "shooting" method for
estimation of energy eigenvalues.

You will need LaTeX to typeset the document, Sage to perform the simulations
and plotting, and SageTeX to enable in-line display of execution results.
